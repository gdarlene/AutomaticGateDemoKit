# 🚪 AutomaticGateDemoKit

**AutomaticGateDemoKit** is a modular demonstration system that simulates an automatic gate using sensors, a microcontroller ( Arduino), and actuators. This project is great for education, prototyping, and learning automation and IoT.

## 🔧 Features

- 📡 Motion detection using ultrasonic 
- 🧠 Microcontroller-based logic (Arduino)   
- 🚦 LED indicators for gate status (red for closed and blue for open)  
- ⚙️ Servo motor driver integration to simulate gate movement

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Hardware
- 1x Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
- 1x Ultrasonic 
- 1x Servo motor 
- LEDs.

### Software
- Arduino IDE

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutomaticGateDemoKit.git
cd AutomaticGateDemoKit
2. Upload the firmware
Open firmware/AutomaticGate.ino in Arduino IDE

Select your board and port

Upload the code
```

## 🧪 How It Works
- Sensor detects motion.

- Motor opens the gate.

- After delay (5 seconds), gate closes.

## 💡 Use Cases

- STEM school projects

- Smart home automation demo

- Prototype for smart village gates

- Embedded systems learning
